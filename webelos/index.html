  <h3 class="text-center">Hello Webelos and Arrow of Light Den/Pack Leaders and Parents</h3>
  <p>
    Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls are invited to our ghoulishly fun Halloween Orienteering Event 
    at St. Edwards State Park (note location has changed) on Monday, October 18th from 6:30-8:15pm. 
    Model after Cascade Orienteering Club's annual Vampire-O, this is a giant field game, where participants 
    need to find as many checkpoints as possible without being bitten by the vampires that roam the land. 
    It's a combo of Treasure Quest and a Game of Tag or Capture The Flag. We will form groups of 2 or 3 and 
    the game will be about 45 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bring a flashlight or headlamp, compass (if you have one) and a whistle. Dress appropriately for the weather. 
    There will be a photo booth and flashing trinkets. Costume is optional. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Check-in is 6:30pm at the picnic tables behind St. Edwards seminary's gymnasium. 
    <strong>There is no parking at St. Edwards after dusk. Please park vehicles at Arrowhead Elementary and walk to the park.</strong> 
    We will walk back together as a group to Arrowhead Elementary after the event.

  <h3 class="text-center">Our Invitation</h3>
  <p>
    The Boy Troop 570 and the Girl Troop 570 of Kirkland are hosting a one-night car camping trip at Camp Pigott on November 5 and 6.
  </p>
  <p>
    All Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts are invited to come along with a parent and join us for one of our more exciting trips of the year!
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center">Meals</h3>
  <p>
    Bring your own "sack" lunch for Saturday and any snacks that you might want. Troop 570 will cook Saturday dinner and Sunday breakfast!
    Adults are encouraged to visit with us as we prepare the evening meal.  We will have hot tea and coffee available at all times for the adults.
    Please tell us about any allergies or dietary restrictions when you RSVP.
  </p>
  <p>Everyone should have extra food for themselves in case of emergency (extra
    food is one of the 10 essentials).
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center">Gear to Bring</h3>
    <p>
      Bring your Webelos handbook as you will have the chance to work on some
    activity badge requirements.
    </p>
    
    <p>Prepare as you would for outdoor overnight Fall outing.  The standard BSA
    Webelos Scout Overnight Checklist in the Cub Scout Leaders Book (page 34-50) is
    a good one to use.  You can also <a
    href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34-50.pdf">download the checklist
    from scouting.org</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Bring a tent if you have one or let us know if you want to borrow a tent
    when you RSVP.</p>
    
    <p>Coordinate whatever group equipment you might need including but not limited
    to: Tents with poles, stakes, ground cloths and lines, dining fly (in case of
    liquid sunshine). If you feel you are lacking any other gear, please contact us 
    as our Troop probably has it and would be happy to let you borrow it for the weekend.</p>
    
    <p>You are encouraged to put together a skit, song or run-on for the Saturday
    evening campfire program. Make sure you bring any props you might need for it.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">Fee</h3>
    <p>The fee for the campout is $10 per person.</p>
  </div>

<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  <h3 class="text-center">Activities</h3>
  <p>
    We have many activities planned for the weekend. The Scouts will teach the Webelos skills like 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>fire building</li>
      <li>knife & axe safety</li>
      <li>knots & lashings</li>
      <li>orienteering and more</li>
    </ul>  
    <p>On Saturday evening, Troop 570 will cook dinner for you. Afterwards, there
      is going to be an evening campfire program with skits, songs and stories.
      Webelos are encouraged to participate by adding their own skits, songs or
      run-ons. On Sunday, you will join the patrols for Sunday breakfast.

  <p>
    We will meet at 9:30 am on Saturday morning, November 5th at the north end of the Kingsgate Park and Ride parking lot and caravan to Camp Pigott. 
    We will depart from Camp Pigott around noon on Sunday afternoon, November 6th.

  <p>
