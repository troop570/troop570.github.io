  <p>Our 2023 Christmas Tree Pickup and Recycling Community Service Project was a success. Thank you to all who donated to our troop. </p>
  <p>All trees collected during this service project are chipped and reused as mulch to maintain Kirkland Parks. This mulch is preferred over commercial mulches simply because it's cleaner.</p>
  <div class="option-box text-center">
